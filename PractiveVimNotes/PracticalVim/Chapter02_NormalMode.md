## Chapter 02 - Normal Mode (12 pages)

- `Normal` mode is Vim's natural resting mode
- *Just as a painter spends a fraction of their time applying paint, programmers spend a fraction of their time composing code.*

### Tip 07 - Pause with Your Brush Off the Page

- Make `Normal` your default (make it a habit)

### Tip 08 - Chunk Your Undos

- Entering Insert mode and leaving to Normal *typically* corresponds to an `undo`able chunk

### Tip 09 - Compose Repeatable Changes

- `daw` delete a wor (works great with the `.` operator
- *Develop a habit of making your changes repeatable wherever possible, then Vim will reward you for it*

### Tip 10 - Use Counts to Do Simple Arithmetic

- `<C-a>` adds a number to the current line
- `<C-x>` subtracts a number to the current line

### Tip 11 - Don't Count If You Can Repeat

- No real useful advice here other than don't over count when a repeat might suffice

### Tip 12 - Combine and Conquer

- `dap` deletes a paragraph
- *An `action` is composed from an `operator` followed by a `motion`*
